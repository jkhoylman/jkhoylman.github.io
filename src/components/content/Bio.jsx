        <p>
          I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, living with my wonderful family, namely my parents, older sister, and a varying number of cats.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first great passion in life was Lego Bionicle and as a kid I would obsessively read the monthly Lego magazine, 
          which led me to stumble across the Lego Mindstorms NXT in the very back of each issue.  
          After years of longingly admiring it in print, I finally got my hands on one when I joined FLL team Moderately Confused in sixth grade.  
          At the end of my three years on the team, we had become one of the most formidable teams in the state, competing at the world championship in 2011 
          and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEdzXVLk9TU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">winning an international competition</a> for our project in 2012. 
          In 2013 we would apply for a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140217184A1/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">patent for the project</a> and receive it in 2015.  
          I owe so much to this program and cannot imagine what my life would look like today were it not for the incredible support our team and many others received from 
          the Dublin Robotics Boosters and the countless volunteers that made it possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In high school at Dublin Coffman, I continued to participate in numerous FIRST programs.  
          I was a founding member of our district's first FTC team, 6150 Moderately Dangerous as well as the de facto mechanical leader all four of my years.  
          On our FRC team, 1014 Bad Robot, I put in hundreds of hours every year. 
          I was honored to be named Best Freshman my first year, serve as the leader of our drive train subteam my junior year, 
          and co-lead the entire 50+ member team to one of its best regional tournament finishes in team history my senior year. 
          During this time, I was also a member of our varsity Quiz Team starting sophomore year and competed in the televised In The Know tournament, going as far as the semi-finals one year.  
          In June of 2016, I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a 4.447 GPA.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the fall of 2016, I started college at The Ohio State University, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering and minoring in Mathematics.  
          While at OSU, I participated in numerous hackathons, joined a casual debate club, and served as the secretary for the Bubble Soccer club.  
          In May of 2020 I graduated, earning my diploma with honors.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing school, I moved to Pleasanton, California to begin my professional career with Veeva Systems.  
          I figured that after staying in town for college, if I didn't try leaving the area right then I probably never would.  
          After about a year and a quarter on the West Coast, I decided to move back to Ohio to be closer to friends and family.  
          Though my time there was brief, it taught me a lot about myself, and I have no regrets about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently reside in Hilliard, Ohio, where I purchased my first house in January of 2024, and have no plans to leave any time soon.
