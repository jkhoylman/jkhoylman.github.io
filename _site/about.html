	Until someone decides that I'm important enough to get a Wikipedia page, this page will serve as the definitive resource on yours truly.
	<br><br>
	I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, living with my parents, older sister, and a varying number of cats.
	<br><br>
	I first found my passion for engineering in middle school, when I joined an FLL team called Moderately Confused.  At the end of my three years on the team, we had become one of the most formidable teams in the state, competing at the world championship in 2011 and winning an international competition for our project in 2012.  In 2013 we would apply for a patent for this project and receive it in 2015.
	<br><br>
	In high school, I continued to participate in FIRST programs.  I was a founding member of our district's first FTC team, 6150 Moderately Dangerous, and was the de facto mechanical leader all four years.  On our FRC team, 1014 Bad Robot, I put in hundreds of hours every year.  I was honored to be named Best Freshman my first year, serve as the leader of our drive train subteam my junior year, and co-lead the entire 50+ member team to its best regional tournament finish in team history my senior year.  Also while in high school, I was a member of our varsity Quiz Team starting sophomore year and competed in the televised In The Know tournament.
	<br><br>
	I graduated from Dublin Coffman High School in 2016 and started college at The Ohio State University, where I expect to graduate with honors in May 2020.  At college I've been a part of many intermural sport leagues, joined a casual debate club, and served as the secretary for the Bubble Soccer club.
	<br><br>
	Post-graduation, I will be relocating to the Bay Area to start my career with Veeva Systems.
